Lots of settings are done for my pc, so I don't know how to make these dotfiles appropriate to anyone else. For example, the sound fixing in i3 as well as keyobard & mouse settings are done specifically for my devices. 

This is what I have so far. Hope someone finds some tips & tricks that I use in configs useful.

### Key features
- Custom battery charging animation
- The colors on polybar change by pywal according to current colorscheme from the wallppapers. Same for terminal applications (tui-based).
